    <descript>
      <abstract>Green infrastructure increasingly is used to ameliorate water quality and quantity problems caused by runoff in cities. Studies show how the spatial distribution of these Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) sites are unevenly distributed relative to socioeconomic and demographic groups. Often this is described as an indicator of perpetuated environment injustice, given the purported social and environmental benefits of GSI. To assess equity, researchers often examine either who gets what with respect to environmental ‘goods’ such as tree canopy and other green infrastructures, or investigate the procedures, decision making processes, and power structures pertaining to planning processes. 
	  
The data publication contains GSI location data collected from 2013-2021. It also contains information regarding who lives in nearby New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, these data include four (4) vector polygon shapefiles representing census block groups, neighborhoods, sewer, and watershed outlines and two (2) point shapefiles representing green infrastructure and combined sewer overflow locations. An R Markdown (.rmd) file is also included containing analysis steps.</abstract>
      <purpose>The intention of providing these data is to accelerate and enable other future researchers interested in GSI and Environmental Justice, and to allow students to access data for use in classes in geographic information systems, urban studies, statistics, environmental justice, and related.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Because of New Haven’s relatively small geographic and population size (relative to other often-studied areas), and the few green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) actors on the scene, we can be reasonably confident that the entire universe of street-side bioswales are accounted for.
	  	  
Census has its margins of error, the land cover is documented elswhere, the GSI points are accurate enough to land in the correct neighobrhood or block group via a spatial join. As described in Locke et al. (2021), we manually reassigned three points from an industrial area (Long Warf) to the adjacent neighborhood.

        <procdesc>The shapefile "neighborhoods.shp" boundaries and demographic data came from DataHaven. DataHaven is a non-profit organization based in New Haven that developed neighborhood boundaries with the city in 2012, in order to support the Comprehensive Plan Data Book. Most of the neighborhood boundaries align with 2010 Census tract boundaries, but there are a few instances where Census tracts or block groups are split, to better match locally-relevant understandings of neighborhoods. DataHaven created neighborhood estimates by allocating Census data to corresponding neighborhoods using the share of population or households that fell within each geographic area. The very small number of people and households living within the boundaries of the city’s Long Wharf neighborhood, which is predominantly a commercial and industrial area, were automatically assigned to the directly adjacent neighborhood called the Hill.</procdesc>
